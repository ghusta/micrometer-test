== Overview

Micrometer provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in.
Think SLF4J, but for application metrics!
Application metrics recorded by Micrometer are intended to be used to observe, alert, and react to the current/recent operational state of your environment.

== Implementations tested

* JMX
* Prometheus
